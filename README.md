# Building a Web Calculator: HTML/CSS Implementation

## Introduction
In this project, you are tasked with creating a web calculator based on a provided design specification. The calculator's design is outlined in a PNG format, and your objective is to translate this design into HTML and CSS code. The calculator will be a static representation without functional logic, focusing solely on the visual representation.

## Tasks

1. Create a new repository on GitHub to manage your project.
2. Clone the repository to your local computer.
3. Develop the HTML structure and CSS styling for the calculator based on the provided design spec.
4. Ensure that the calculator design matches the provided spec as closely as possible.
5. Set up GitHub Pages to host your `index.html` file.
6. Update the repository settings to reflect the GitHub Pages URL for easy access to your calculator.

## Notes

- While striving to match the design specification, prioritize functionality over pixel-perfect design.
- The primary focus is on building the static layout; JavaScript functionality will be added in subsequent assignments.
- Experiment with additional styling and features to enhance the calculator's appearance and usability.

## Stretch Goals

1. Implement hover states for buttons to enhance interactivity.
2. Introduce shadows to provide depth and visual appeal to the calculator.
3. Add a 'light mode / dark mode' switch using only HTML and CSS, without JavaScript. Utilize CSS selectors to toggle between color themes based on checkbox state.

## Design Spec

Refer to the provided PNG image for the visual representation of the calculator design. Use it as a reference while implementing the HTML and CSS code.
